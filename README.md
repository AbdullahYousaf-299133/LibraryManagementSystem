# What is this application?

  It is basically a Library Management System that can perform all the functions a Library might need for the computerization of their systems.
  It can perform many required tasks such as:
  
     - Keep Record of Issue and Return of Books.
     - Update or Edit a library's collection of Books.
     - Keep Record of all the Members of the library.
     - Seperate dedicated Member and Librarian Portals.
     - and many more...
     
# How to install?
  
  It has a pretty simple proccess:
  
#  First:  
      -You need to download all the files from the given repository
  
#  Second: 
      -You need to have Visual Studio installed in your PC. (Recommended Version: 2012 Ultimate)
  
#  Third: 
      -You need to create a new project in Visual Studio and then add "Library.cpp" in it.
  
 # Fourth:
      -You need to add all the .txt files in the same folder as the cpp.
  
 # Lastly: 
      -You can now just run the code on Visual Studio and a self-explanatory menu will pop up.
      
   
   
 # *Text File Format*
   Make sure all the .txt files are in the following pattern:
   
      *Books.txt*
